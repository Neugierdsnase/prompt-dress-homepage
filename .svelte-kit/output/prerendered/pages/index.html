Here are some tips:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Be Clear\u003C/strong>: Your prompt should be clear and to the point, to guide the LLM toward the result you want. If your prompt is vague, you might get answers you didn’t expect.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Provide Context\u003C/strong>: Including some relevant information can help the LLM understand better what you’re asking for. This way, you’re likely to get more accurate responses.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Experiment with Length and Structure\u003C/strong>: The way you structure your prompt, and how long or short it is, can affect the answers you get. Feel free to try different approaches to see what works best.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Keep Improving\u003C/strong>: Prompt engineering isn’t a one-time task.

A popular way to do this is to propose a role play, asking ChatGPT to take on the role of a competent and knowledgeable counterpart. This is an example of this:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“You are a realtor writing copy for the new listing they want to sell or rent.

Once that’s clear, you can start creating prompts that will lead to the responses you want.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"how-to-create-good-prompts\">\u003Ca class=\"heading-link\" title=\"Permalink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#how-to-create-good-prompts\">\u003Cspan>#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>How to Create Good Prompts\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Creating good prompts is part science, part art. It requires thinking about what the language model can and can’t do while making your requests. Here are some tips:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Be Clear\u003C/strong>: Your prompt should be clear and to the point, to guide the LLM toward the result you want. If your prompt is vague, you might get answers you didn’t expect.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Provide Context\u003C/strong>: Including some relevant information can help the LLM understand better what you’re asking for. This way, you’re likely to get more accurate responses.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Experiment with Length and Structure\u003C/strong>: The way you structure your prompt, and how long or short it is, can affect the answers you get. Feel free to try different approaches to see what works best.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Keep Improving\u003C/strong>: Prompt engineering isn’t a one-time task. It’s about trying different things, seeing what works, and refining your prompts based on what you learn.\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusion\">\u003Ca class=\"heading-link\" title=\"Permalink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#conclusion\">\u003Cspan>#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>Conclusion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Prompt engineering is a handy skill when working with language models. By learning how to craft effective prompts, we can have better interactions with these models. So, the next time you work with an LLM, take some time to think about your prompts, experiment, and see how the right prompt can lead to better results.\u003C/p>",readingTime:"2 min read",relatedPosts:[{slug:"prompt-engineering-for-real-estate-listings",title:"Prompt Engineering: A real life example EVERYONE can use (but I'm using real estate as an example)",date:"2023-10-07T08:11:21.800Z",excerpt:"Explore the basics of prompt engineering and improve your interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs).

He knows I’m a software engineer, and we sometimes ask questions about each other’s professions. I inquire about the real estate market, and he about software.

So, let’s take this very use case, and unravel how a prompt engineer might tackle this task step-by-step.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/zaezT79s3Ng7C/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\">\n\u003Ch2 id=\"setting-the-right-context\">\u003Ca class=\"heading-link\" title=\"Permalink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#setting-the-right-context\">\u003Cspan>#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>Setting the right context\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>First off, we need to set the proper context. A popular way to do this is to propose a role play, asking ChatGPT to take on the role of a competent and knowledgeable counterpart. This is an example of this:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“You are a realtor writing copy for the new listing they want to sell or rent. You have a specific structure you always want to adhere to and a specific tone in which you like these texts to be written.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>I will give examples of text I like, and I want you to reproduce their structure and tone with the information about the new objects I will provide you afterwards.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we submit the prompt like this, the model will respond by reiterating the key points of the prompt, which is unnecessary, so I like to end all my “priming” prompts with: \u003Cem>“If you understand, just reply with READ.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Side note:\u003C/strong> This also conveniently \u003Ca href=\"https://www.aidare.com/what-are-tokens-and-their-role-in-chatgpt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">saves us some tokens.\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Perfect, so now we have the initial prompt set up, and we might need to come back to it later and tweak it a bit. Still, it is a great start, so I will save that prompt into my \u003Ca href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prompt-dress/mpcinhhegdohpapgmiopjlfhemhhfmid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prompt Dress browser extension\u003C/a> so that I always have it ready the next time I need it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"adding-templates-to-let-the-ai-know-the-style-we-like\">\u003Ca class=\"heading-link\" title=\"Permalink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#adding-templates-to-let-the-ai-know-the-style-we-like\">\u003Cspan>#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>Adding templates to let the AI know the style we like\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Cool. Now, I will continue by pasting in some of the text I’d like ChatGPT to use as templates. So, I found these texts for some random London apartments online that I will use here. \u003Ca href=\"https://paste.bingner.com/paste/fsm22/raw\" rel=\"nofollow\">I pasted them in this bin so you can reproduce my workflow.\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alright, so I like to open the prompt with the disclaimer that this is one of the examples. I paste in the text, and then I end the prompt with something that will shorten the response again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Quick recap: The structure now is:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“This is one of the examples I would like you to follow.\u003C/em>\u003Cbr>\n\u003Cem>[one of the mentioned examples I put in this bin]\u003C/em>\u003Cbr>\n\u003Cem>If you understand, reply READ.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"priming-done-lets-prompt\">\u003Ca class=\"heading-link\" title=\"Permalink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#priming-done-lets-prompt\">\u003Cspan>#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>Priming done, let’s prompt\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>So, after this is done, it’s finally time to get to the good parts. We can consider our AI sufficiently primed for our use case and now prompt it for the task we want to perform. I tried this with the following made-up example.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“I now have a new listing with the following stats: 80 square meters plus 15 square meter balcony, location relatively central, but in a bad neighbourhood. Third floor. Bathroom and toilet separately. The main selling point is that it is bright. Generate a listing for this object.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The result is spot-on. The text generated follows the templates given in structure and tone and cleverly describes the downsides positively. I would be confident that any real estate agent would be satisfied with the result as-is (provided the templates given are ones they like).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Know that what I just showed you is a widespread technique used by many people to get the results they want, but since this worked so well, I now want to save the work I’ve done. Until now, this was mostly a matter of having some text files lying around somewhere, which quickly gets messy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That’s why I made a browser extension to tackle this problem, first for myself, then I decided to share it with you guys and called it “Prompt Dress”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Please let me know if you found this helpful via the appropriate buttons or commenting.
