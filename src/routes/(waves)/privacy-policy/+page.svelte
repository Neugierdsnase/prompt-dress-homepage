<p>I do not collect any personal information from you. I do not store any information about you.</p>

<p>
	I use <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://counter.dev">
		this privacy enthusiastic counter</a
	> to count the number of visitors to this site. That's it. The extension doesn't even have a backend,
	so there isn't even a server to store anything. All your data is stored in your own browser and never
	leaves.

<p>
	If this ever changes, it will be an option to actively opt-in to any data collection. (For example
	if network features are requested a lot by my users.) The current state of the extension, however,
	will always stay free and free of data collection.
